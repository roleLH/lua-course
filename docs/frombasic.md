[Guide](/index.md) ðŸ¢’ **I've played with BASIC before**

If you've used BASIC before, then atto will be very familiar to you. atto is a BASIC-like language â€” which means it's essentially BASIC, but with a few modern features added in.

Try running the infamous `Hello, world!` program to see what we mean by it being familiar:

```
10 print "Hello, world!"
20 goto 10
```

You'll notice that atto has syntax highlighting, which is a step up from the original BASIC language, and makes it much easier to read (especially for beginners)! To interrupt the current program and go back to editing, press the Esc key.

You can use `run` to run the program, and you can use the `list` command to list the contents of your program. Notice how you can use the arrow keys to go up and down a line to edit your code â€” this is what makes atto unique from BASIC, in that editing in atto is easier and similar to other programming languages.

For editing your code, the `edit` command (such as running `edit 10`) can be used to modify a line, and the `renum` command can be used to renumber each line number of your program to be a factor of 10 if you run out of in-between lines. It'll even renumber the `goto` commands for you!

As with most BASIC derivatives, typing a line number on its own will delete the line. You can then type `list` to see the code again with the deleted line ommitted.

Importantly, the `new` command will create a new program, which is useful for tinkering with atto to make different projects.

atto supports storing strings and numbers in variables:

```
10 rem Storing a string:
20 string$="Hello!"
30 rem Storing a number:
40 number%=16
50 print string$
60 print number%
```

The `$` suffix will cast a variable to a string, and the `%` suffix will cast a variable to a number. Input works as expected, too:

```
10 input "Enter a number: ", number%
20 print number%; " divided by 2 is "; number%/2
```

Here, `;` is a string concatenation operator, whereas `,` is used to delimit the arguments of a command.

You've finished our introductory guide! Now's a great time to move onto our next guide, where you get to draw shapes and patterns to the screen using the turtle feature in atto. It's similar to the Logo programming language, if you've used that!

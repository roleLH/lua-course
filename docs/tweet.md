[Guide](/index.md) 🢒 **Tweet your code**

Tweet your program! If your code can fit in a Tweet, then send our Twitter bot (<a href="https://twitter.com/codeurdreams" target="_blank">@codeurdreams</a>) a Tweet containing your code, and our bot will reply with a screenshot of your running code.

Below is what your current code will look like when put in a Tweet. Press the **Tweet** button to send it from your current Twitter Account!

<div class="tweetableCode"></div>

Your Tweet will be <strong class="tweetableCodeSize">---</strong> characters long.

---

⚠️ You'll need to ensure that your Tweet is at most **280** characters long, or otherwise you won't be able to post it.

🗜️ Longer Tweets are encoded in base2048, which means that your code will be compressed to fit up to around 100 more code characters in a single Tweet! Conversion to base2048 is done automatically if your original code is over 280 characters in length.
